In this post, I'll introduce my AI grant submission for Spring 2018.

It has been a few years since I have done research in AI or robotics. I am 
still partial to embodiment, and I have been learning about different 
reinforcement learning approaches with the help of Barto and Sutton's book. 
I hope publish some code and notes eventually.

Although I've been wanting to get back to try out new cognitive architectures 
and control ideas, I have not had the resources. I still have Kirikou, my NAO 
humanoid, although his battery won't let him stay on. But I don't have the GPU 
power for many of the experiments I'm thinking about trying. My attempt at 
building a machine for DL failed, the system remains unstable.

The AI Grant should fix that by providing a lot of cloud computing budget, which 
I will have to hook up with the simulator. I will also try again to create a GPU
machine for local experiments with Kirikou, and will try to get a new battery as
well as the version 5 of the NAO head.
