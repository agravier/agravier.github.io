### The website

This is a personal website. I've made it using Jekyll. It is
graciously hosted by Github. Math formatting is done with
MathJax. Comments are powered by Disqus. The main CSS is a heavily
modified version of the Slate Theme for GitHub Pages by Jason
Costello. The CSS used for code highlighting is a modified version of
one of the styles generated by Pygments. You can reuse those
stylesheets and the website layout if you want, but please remove all
the contents (texts, images, binaries, favicon, ...) before
publishing. If you reuse my design, It would be cool to let me know,
so as I can boast about it.

### The contents

All the contents are my own creation if not stated otherwise. If you
think that I've misattributed or forgotten to source something, please
email me. You may also **partially** reproduce the contents of the
texts I publish on this website, provided that you properly cite
me. You may **not** reproduce any **non-textual content ("artwork")**
or any full text without my explicit permission.
