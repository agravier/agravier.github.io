### About the website

This is a personal website. I've made it using Jekyll. It is
graciously hosted by Github. Math formatting is done with MathJax.
The main CSS is a heavily modified version of the Slate Theme for
GitHub Pages by Jason Costello. The CSS used for code highlighting is
a modified version of one of the styles generated by Pygments. You can
reuse those stylesheets and the website layout if you want, but please
remove all my contents before publishing. If you reuse my design, It
would be cool to let me know, so as I can boast about it.

### About the contents

All the contents are my own creation if not said otherwise. If you
think that I've misattributed or forgotten to source something, please
email me. You may also partially reproduce the contents of the texts I
publish on this website, provided that you properly cite me. You may
**not** reproduce any **non-textual content ("artwork")** without my
explicit permission.
